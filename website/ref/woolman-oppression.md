Oppression in the extreme appears terrible: but oppression in more refined appearances remains to be oppression; and where the smallest degree of it is cherished it grows stronger and more extensive. 

To labour for a perfect redemption from this spirit of oppression is the great business of the whole family of Christ Jesus in this world.

-- John Woolman, 1763
