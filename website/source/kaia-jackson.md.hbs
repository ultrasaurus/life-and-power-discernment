the capacity of every story to change the shape of what we know to be true. Their work centers the voices of youth,
trauma survivors and disabled folks through theatre, writing and expressive arts.

historically silenced experiences in intergenerational community spaces, and previously served on the Collective
Leadership Team with Survivor Theatre Project.

practices. Kaia received a B.A. in Interdisciplinary Arts from Hampshire College, an MDiv from Earlham School of
