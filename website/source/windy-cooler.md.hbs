**Windy Cooler** (she/her) is an embraced public Friend and the assistant clerk of Sandy Spring Monthly Meeting, Baltimore
Yearly Meeting. Her ministry has long centered on caregiving in times of crisis in peer to peer religious communities,
such as Quakers, and in group discernment: finding the wisdom in communities to address sticky issues. A regular guest
of Quaker communities in the United States, and more recently in the United Kingdom, she is also Pendle Hillâ€™s 2020
Cadbury Scholar and a 2022-23 fellow of Odyssey Impact, a change-making organization that centers story-telling as a
strategy for building social justice.

In the last year, in addition to serving as convener of Life and Power, she has been invited to present original
research, retreats and keynotes for communities including Woodbrooke, Pendle Hill, Friends Association for Higher
Education, the Washington Friends Conference on Religion and Psychology, Friends Journal, Quaker Religious Education
Collaborative, Quaker Religious Thought and Southeastern Yearly Meeting. She is also serving as convener of Testimonies
to Mercy, a seven part series on the future of Quakerism jointly sponsored by Powell House and Ben Lomond Quaker
Centers.

She lives in Greenbelt, Maryland with her spouse, Erik Hanson, and son, Ob. Her adult daughter, Maggie Willow, lives
nearby. Windy holds a master of divinity from Earlham School of Religion and is a doctoral candidate at Lancaster
Theological Seminary.
