On Saturday, April 15th 2023, Life and Power’s convener, Windy Cooler, joined Stephanie Krehbiel, the executive director
of the survivor’s advocacy organization Into Account With Our Stories Untold,, and Friends General Conference (FGC) in a
public discussion of the Academy Award winning film about discernment in response to abuse, Women Talking. The film,
taken from the book of the same name, is a fictional account of a plain community of Mennonite women and children who,
in response to sexual assault, spiritually discern to leave their homes together. Below is the transcript of the
discussion which ranges from the question “is this movie really about Mennonites?” to “how is power relevant to
discernment processes?” The transcript begins abruptly while Stephanie answers Windy asking about whether one can say
that this film is about Mennonites. The answer, you will see, is complicated.

Lori Sinitzky is the moderator. Katherine Tate served as chaplin. The transcript and also an audio recording (available
below), is thanks to the labor of our Friends at FGC, most especially the staff of Spiritual Deepening at FGC: nova
george and Rachel Ernst Stahlhut.

## Discussion Questions
Before reading the transcript you might ask yourself the following discussion questions from FGC:

* Does pacifism require removing yourself from potential violence?
* “I was struck by the acknowledgement that "forgiveness" became understood by the hierarchy as permission.... The classic
abuse of power over, then, is allowed to persist. The women in the room finally came to terms with the harm that does to
everyone. “ What does forgiveness look like in a Quaker/spiritual context?
* How does this movie support us in noticing systems of oppression and the internalization of oppression within our
meetings?
* How might we navigate the transmitted trauma and strive to heal? What does it look like to name traumatic experiences in
religious and faith based spaces?
* These patterns seem to be very prevalent in Quaker organizations as well as the faith community, a demand for the
excusing of abuse. How do we hold our communities accountable in these situations?
* Does being a peacemaker require us to address violence and work to create space to support healing?
