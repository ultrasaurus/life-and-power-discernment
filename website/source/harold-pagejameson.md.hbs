>“I am glad to be one of the listeners available for this project. Abuse can take many forms and have far reaching
effects. My own experiences of abuse are not all simple or clear, and I don’t expect anyone else’s to be either. If you
are unsure whether your story is clear enough or impactful enough to be listened to, but you still would like to tell
it, then I am willing to listen.”
