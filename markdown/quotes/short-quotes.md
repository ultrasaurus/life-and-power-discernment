”I don’t do the good that I want to do, instead I do the evil that I don’t want to do” 
— Romans 7:15-20

“Oppression in the extreme appears terrible: but oppression in more refined appearances remains to be oppression; and where the smallest degree of it is cherished it grows stronger and more extensive. To labour for a perfect redemption from this spirit of oppression is the great business of the whole family of Christ Jesus in this world.”
